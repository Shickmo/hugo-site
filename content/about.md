### Welcome to my Sanctum Sanctorum


### Who am I?

My name is Ray but I also go by Shickmo. I am beginning a YouTube channel, which you can check out by clicking the link below, and this website / blog. This site and YouTube channel will focus on technology, Linux (and everything that comes with it, and all things open source. So if you like anything even remotely in the realm of those topics and like to hear about cool open source projects and enjoy learning new things than I have a feeling you might just want to stick around.

### How to get in touch?

Want to connect with me online? You can drop me a line on twitter or drop me an email at ray@shickmo.io (or click the email link at the bottom of the page).

### How to get involved?

If you like the content I produce here or on my channel consider dropping me a couple bucks by becoming a patron and if you aren't able to do that no worries just sharing my content with others would be a very rad way to help out this humble nerd.
