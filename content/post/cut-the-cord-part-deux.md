This is a small addendum to the my original [Cutting the cord](/post/first-post) article. If you haven't read that article pop over there than come on back here. Okay now that we are caught up below are the quick vital links / stats for Sling:

* [Sling TV](https://www.sling.com/)
* Plans:
  * Orange - $20/mo (Stream to one device at a time)
  * Blue - $25/mo (Stream to three devices simultaneously)
  * Orange + Blue - $35/mo (Stream to four devices simultaneously)
* [Channel Lineup](https://www.sling.com/service)
* [Supported Devices](https://www.sling.com/devices)

A question that people keep asking me about my original article is how they can get Hallmark and Hallmark Movies & Mysteries channels if they cut the cord. The short answer is the only legal way to get those channels and still cut the cord is through Sling.

The cheapest way to achieve that goal is to purchase the Orange Plan for $20/mo and add on the $5 Lifestyle package. That said if watching the Hallmark channels is a must during this holiday filled time of the year than Sling is your fastest way to a very Merry Christmas.
