A site at example.com/subdir/ will still resolve the link to example.com/path/to/image.jpg, which won&amp;rsquo;t exist.To get around this limitation (at least until it gets implemented in Hugo), BluestNight includes a shortcode called static that will correctly resolve links to static files according to the site&amp;rsquo;s baseURL. The syntax is similar to the ref and relref shortcodes:![Image alt text]({{&amp;lt; static &amp;quot;path/under/static/folder/file.jpg&amp;quot; &amp;gt;}}) [Link text]({{&amp;lt; static &amp;quot;other/static/folder/file.txt&amp;quot; &amp;gt;}})  Example output, using a baseURL of http://example.com/subdir/:Link text ",

If you set custom_prev or custom_next to &amp;quot;none&amp;quot;, its corresponding button will not be created.

This background is applied to the navigation bar, footer, various buttons, and as the alternate color for zebra-striped tables. main_text is the font color that corresponds with main_background. alt_text is the font color that corresponds with alt_background. accent is the color applied to the site header, links, and buttons that are hovered over or marked active. accent_text is the font color that is used when accent is being used as the background color.

Hashover BluestNight supports using the HashOver self-hosted comment system. Note that this comment system requires PHP and cannot be used on services that do not support PHP.Notes  This guide assumes that you have a server set up to use PHP.** All relative paths are relative to the root of your Hugo site  This means that BluestNight is installed to themes/BluestNight   Installation BluestNight has HashOver bundled with it, so you do not need to do anything to &amp;ldquo;install&amp;rdquo; it as of this time. This may change in the future.Setup  Copy the file secrets.php from themes/BluestNight/static/hashover/scripts/secrets.php to static/hashover/scripts/secrets.php. This prevents your changes from be overridden on updates to the theme. Open static/hashover/scripts/secrets.php in your favorite text editor and find these lines:  $encryption_key = &#39;8CharKey&#39;; // Unique 8 to 32 character encryption key $notification_email = &#39;example@example.com&#39;; // E-mail for notification of new comments $admin_nickname = &#39;admin&#39;; // Nickname with admin rights (must be title-cased) $admin_password = &#39;passwd&#39;; // Password to gain admin rights  Replace the encryption key with a randomly generated key, such as from this generator. Replace the notification email with one that you want to receive notifications of new comments. Replace the admin password with a secure password that you can use to verify yourself to delete/edit comments and perform other administrative actions.  Customization Custom color schemes are applied to HashOver comments.Muut For those who don&amp;rsquo;t want to also host the comments on their site, BluestNight provides support for Muut. For more about the decision to support Muut, click here.Click here for a current comparison between the free and paid tiers of Muut&amp;rsquo;s service.Setup To begin, sign up for a free Muut account. Make sure to keep track of the name you give your Muut Community, as you will need that information later. You may be automatically enrolled in a free trial of a paid subscription. You will be dropped down to a free subscription at the end of the trial.Remember the name you gave your Muut community? That will go in your site&amp;rsquo;s configuration file as the value for muut under Params:# In config.toml [Params] muut = &amp;quot;mycommunity&amp;quot;  After running hugo, you should now have Muut comments on all pages you have them enabled on.",
